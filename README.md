Machine learning project to predict hospital insurance costs from patient data
## Project Description
This project aims to predict the expected hospitalization or medical insurance costs for patients using demographic and clinical data. Leveraging machine learning regression models, the goal is to assist healthcare providers and insurers in estimating treatment costs accurately, thereby improving financial planning and resource allocation.

## Dataset
We use the Medical Cost Personal Dataset (`insurance.csv`) sourced from Kaggle. The dataset contains 1,338 entries with features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Number of children/dependents
- Smoking status
- Residential region
- Claim Amount (medical costs) â€” target variable
